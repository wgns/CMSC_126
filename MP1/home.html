		Hi there and welcome to my website! My name is Wina Gen Sotto.<br>
		You can get to know me more using this site.<br><br>
		I was born on June 12, 1998, the same day as the Philippines' Independence Day.<br>
		During my spare time, I enjoy playing video games, watching anime, or<br>
		making different kinds of bracelets. My favorite color is lavender<br>
		and my favorite food is ice cream.<br><br>
